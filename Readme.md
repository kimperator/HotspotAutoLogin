Hotspot Auto Login
==================

Intention
---------

When you are using Hotspots from the German Telekom, than you will be disconnected after 15 minutes of inactivity.
So if you use your smart phone only sporadically, this is quite annoying. I want to use this small program on my Notebook and on my Android telephone.


Limitations
-----------
On Android Marshmallow it is possible to bind one program to one specific interface. The default behaviour is that mobile data is used over Wifi, when the WiFi is not fully connected.

As a workaround I disable mobile data with the App Tasker and AutoInput-Plugin, before I send the login credentials.
Afterwards mobile data is enable again.
